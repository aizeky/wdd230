    <p>An <b>echocardiogram</b> (echo) is a test that uses high frequency sound waves 
        (ultrasound) to make pictures of your heart. The test is also called 
        echocardiography or diagnostic cardiac ultrasound.</p>

    <p>A cardiac echo uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart’s chambers, 
        valves, walls and the blood vessels (aorta, arteries, veins) attached to your heart.​</p>

    <p>A probe called a transducer is passed over your chest. The probe produces sound
         waves that bounce off your heart and “echo” back to the probe. These waves are 
         changed into pictures viewed on a video monitor.​</p>

    <ul>
        <p>For example, a cardiac echo can tell the following:</p>
        <li>The size and shape of your heart, and the size, thickness and movement of your heart’s walls.​</li>
        <li>How your heart moves.</li>
        <li>The heart’s pumping strength.</li>
        <li>If the heart valves are working correctly.</li>
        <li>If blood is leaking backwards through your heart valves (regurgitation).</li>
        <li>If the heart valves are too narrow (stenosis).</li>
        <li>If there is a tumor or infectious growth around your heart valves.</li>
    </ul>
