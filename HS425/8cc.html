        <p>In this test, a short tube (sheath) is inserted into a vein or artery in the leg (groin) or arm. A hollow, flexible and longer tube 
            (guide catheter) is then inserted into the sheath. Aided by X-ray images on a monitor, the guide catheter is threaded through that 
            artery into the aorta and into the heart.​</p>

        <p>Once the catheter is in place, several tests may be done. The tip of the catheter can be placed into various parts of the heart to 
            measure the pressures within the heart chambers or take blood samples to measure oxygen levels.</p>

        <p>The catheter can also be guided into the coronary arteries and inject contrast dye to check blood flow through them.  The dye can 
            be seen on an X-ray, which shows the blood flow through the heart, blood vessels and valves to check for abnormalities. This is 
            called coronary angiography.​</p>
