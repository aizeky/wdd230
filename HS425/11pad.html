        <h3>Peripheral Arterial Disease</h3>

        <p><b>Physical exam</b>- weak or absent pulse, whooshing sounds over arteries that can be heard with a stethoscope, poor wound healing, and decreased blood pressure.
        </p>

        <p><b>Segmental Pressure Measurements</b> - blood pressure measurements taken at various different locations along the leg.
        </p>

        <p><b>Ankle-brachial index (ABI)</b> - Compares the blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm.  
        </p>

        <p><b>Ultrasound</b> - Special ultrasound imaging techniques, such as Doppler ultrasound, evaluate blood flow through blood vessels and identifies blocked or narrowed arteries.
        </p>

        <p><b>Angiography</b> - Dye (contrast material) injected into blood vessels traces the flow of the contrast material using imaging techniques, such as X-ray imaging or procedures called magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA).
