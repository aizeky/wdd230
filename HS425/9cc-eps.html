        <h2>Cardiac Catheterization – Electrophysiology Study (EPS)</h2>

        <p>Electrophysiology studies (EPS) are tests that provide an understanding of the nature of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).</p>

        <p>​Electrophysiology studies test the electrical activity of your heart to find where an arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat) is coming from.</p>

        <p>These studies take place in a special room called an electrophysiology (EP) lab or catheterization (cath) lab</p>

        <p>During EPS, a thin tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel that leads to your heart. A specialized electrode 
            catheter designed for EP studies lets them send electrical signals to your heart and record its electrical activity.​​</p>

        <ul>
            <p>An EPS study can tell physicians:</p>
            <li>Where the arrhythmia is coming from</li>
            <li>How well certain medications are working to correct the arrhythmia</li>
            <li>If a cardiac ablation is needed</li>
        </ul>
