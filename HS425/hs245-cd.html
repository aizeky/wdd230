        <h3>Echocardiogram</h3>

        <p>An <b>echocardiogram</b> (echo) is a test that uses high frequency sound waves 
            (ultrasound) to make pictures of your heart. The test is also called 
            echocardiography or diagnostic cardiac ultrasound.</p>

        <p>A cardiac echo uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart’s chambers, 
            valves, walls and the blood vessels (aorta, arteries, veins) attached to your heart.​</p>

        <p>A probe called a transducer is passed over your chest. The probe produces sound
             waves that bounce off your heart and “echo” back to the probe. These waves are 
             changed into pictures viewed on a video monitor.​</p>

        <ul>
            <p>For example, a cardiac echo can tell the following:</p>
            <li>The size and shape of your heart, and the size, thickness and movement of your heart’s walls.​</li>
            <li>How your heart moves.</li>
            <li>The heart’s pumping strength.</li>
            <li>If the heart valves are working correctly.</li>
            <li>If blood is leaking backwards through your heart valves (regurgitation).</li>
            <li>If the heart valves are too narrow (stenosis).</li>
            <li>If there is a tumor or infectious growth around your heart valves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Computed Tomography (CT) Scanner</h3>

        <p><b>Tomography</b> is a Greek word coming from “tomos” meaning “section or slices”
             and “graphe” meaning “drawing”​</p>

        <p>The CT uses radioactive rays to produce slices of images that are “stacked” on top
             of each other.</p>

        <p>Typically, the CT scanner makes one rotation per second but depending on the technology
             it can capture multiple slices per rotation or per second ie, 8-slice, 16-slice, 32-slice and so on. </p>

        <h3>Coronary CT Angiography</h3>

        <p><b>Coronary CT angiography</b> (CTA) is the use of computed tomography (CT) angiography to assess the coronary arteries of the heart. ​</p>

        <p>​

            The patient  receives an intravenous injection of radiocontrast and then the heart is scanned 
            using a high-speed CT scanner, allowing physicians to assess the extent of occlusion in the 
            coronary arteries, usually in order to diagnose coronary artery disease. </p>

        <h3>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)​</h3>

        <h3>Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Imaging​</h3>

        <p>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, is a method to image the human heart, and measure how well it functions. 
            A CMR can also visualize and measure blood flow in the heart, aorta and other large vessels.</p>
        
        <p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizes a highly powerful magnet field and radiofrequency waves to create images 
            of the inside of the body.  The MRI technology does not utilize radiation.</p>

        <h3>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)</h3>

        <p>An <b>electrocardiogram</b> is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat. With each beat, an electrical impulse 
            (or “wave”) travels through the heart. This wave causes the muscle to squeeze and pump blood from the heart.</p>
        
        <p>The right and left atria or upper chambers make the first wave called a “P wave" — following a flat line when the electrical impulse 
            goes to the bottom chambers. The right and left bottom chambers or ventricles make the next wave called a “QRS complex”.  The final 
            wave or “T wave” represents electrical recovery or return to a resting state for the ventricles.​</p>

        <ul>
            <p>An ECG can determine: ​</p>
            <li>Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmias)</li>
            <li>If blocked or narrowed arteries in your heart (coronary artery disease) are causing chest pain or a heart attack</li>
            <li>Whether you have had a previous heart attack</li>
            <li>How well certain heart disease treatments, such as a pacemaker, are working</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Holter Monitor – Continuous Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)​</h3>

        <p>A <b>Holter monitor</b> is a portable device you wear to record a continuous ECG, usually for 24 to 72 hours. Holter monitoring is 
            used to detect heart rhythm irregularities that aren't found during a regular ECG exam.​</p>
        
        <h3>Cardiac Catheterization</h3>

        <p>In this test, a short tube (sheath) is inserted into a vein or artery in the leg (groin) or arm. A hollow, flexible and longer tube 
            (guide catheter) is then inserted into the sheath. Aided by X-ray images on a monitor, the guide catheter is threaded through that 
            artery into the aorta and into the heart.​</p>

        <p>Once the catheter is in place, several tests may be done. The tip of the catheter can be placed into various parts of the heart to 
            measure the pressures within the heart chambers or take blood samples to measure oxygen levels.</p>

        <p>The catheter can also be guided into the coronary arteries and inject contrast dye to check blood flow through them.  The dye can 
            be seen on an X-ray, which shows the blood flow through the heart, blood vessels and valves to check for abnormalities. This is 
            called coronary angiography.​</p>

        <h3>Cardiac Catheterization</h3>

        <h3>Cardiac Catheterization – Electrophysiology Study (EPS)</h3>

        <p>Electrophysiology studies (EPS) are tests that provide an understanding of the nature of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).</p>

        <p>​Electrophysiology studies test the electrical activity of your heart to find where an arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat) is coming from.</p>

        <p>These studies take place in a special room called an electrophysiology (EP) lab or catheterization (cath) lab</p>

        <p>During EPS, a thin tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel that leads to your heart. A specialized electrode 
            catheter designed for EP studies lets them send electrical signals to your heart and record its electrical activity.​​</p>

        <ul>
            <p>An EPS study can tell physicians:</p>
            <li>Where the arrhythmia is coming from</li>
            <li>How well certain medications are working to correct the arrhythmia</li>
            <li>If a cardiac ablation is needed</li>
        </ul>
