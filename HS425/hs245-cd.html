        <h3>Echocardiogram</h3>

        <p>An <b>echocardiogram</b> (echo) is a test that uses high frequency sound waves 
            (ultrasound) to make pictures of your heart. The test is also called 
            echocardiography or diagnostic cardiac ultrasound.</p>

        <p>A cardiac echo uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart’s chambers, 
            valves, walls and the blood vessels (aorta, arteries, veins) attached to your heart.​</p>

        <p>A probe called a transducer is passed over your chest. The probe produces sound
             waves that bounce off your heart and “echo” back to the probe. These waves are 
             changed into pictures viewed on a video monitor.​</p>

        <ul>
            <p>For example, a cardiac echo can tell the following:</p>
            <li>The size and shape of your heart, and the size, thickness and movement of your heart’s walls.​</li>
            <li>How your heart moves.</li>
            <li>The heart’s pumping strength.</li>
            <li>If the heart valves are working correctly.</li>
            <li>If blood is leaking backwards through your heart valves (regurgitation).</li>
            <li>If the heart valves are too narrow (stenosis).</li>
            <li>If there is a tumor or infectious growth around your heart valves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Computed Tomography (CT) Scanner</h3>

        <p><b>Tomography</b> is a Greek word coming from “tomos” meaning “section or slices”
             and “graphe” meaning “drawing”​</p>

        <p>The CT uses radioactive rays to produce slices of images that are “stacked” on top
             of each other.</p>

        <p>Typically, the CT scanner makes one rotation per second but depending on the technology
             it can capture multiple slices per rotation or per second ie, 8-slice, 16-slice, 32-slice and so on. </p>

        <h3>Coronary CT Angiography</h3>

        <p><b>Coronary CT angiography</b> (CTA) is the use of computed tomography (CT) angiography to assess the coronary arteries of the heart. ​</p>

        <p>​

            The patient  receives an intravenous injection of radiocontrast and then the heart is scanned 
            using a high-speed CT scanner, allowing physicians to assess the extent of occlusion in the 
            coronary arteries, usually in order to diagnose coronary artery disease. </p>
