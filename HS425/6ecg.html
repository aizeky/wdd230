        <p>An <b>electrocardiogram</b> is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat. With each beat, an electrical impulse 
            (or “wave”) travels through the heart. This wave causes the muscle to squeeze and pump blood from the heart.</p>
        
        <p>The right and left atria or upper chambers make the first wave called a “P wave" — following a flat line when the electrical impulse 
            goes to the bottom chambers. The right and left bottom chambers or ventricles make the next wave called a “QRS complex”.  The final 
            wave or “T wave” represents electrical recovery or return to a resting state for the ventricles.​</p>

        <ul>
            <p>An ECG can determine: ​</p>
            <li>Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmias)</li>
            <li>If blocked or narrowed arteries in your heart (coronary artery disease) are causing chest pain or a heart attack</li>
            <li>Whether you have had a previous heart attack</li>
            <li>How well certain heart disease treatments, such as a pacemaker, are working</li>
        </ul>
